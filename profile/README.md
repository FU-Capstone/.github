## 🧑🏻‍🦰 Get To Know FPT GameHub Team
The FPT GameHub Team is a group of senior students from FPT University who came together with a shared vision to build the GameHub Platform — a dedicated platform for games and design assets exclusively for FPTU Campus students. This project was developed as part of the Spring 2025 Capstone, which took place on May 8th, 2025. Thanks to the commitment and hard work of every core team member, the project was successfully recognized by the evaluation committee.
